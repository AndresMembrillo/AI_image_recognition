## Metric for Evaluation

    üìå &nbsp; 
In a binary classification task like distinguishing between "AI_GENERATED" and "NON_AI_GENERATED" images, accuracy is a fundamental metric for evaluating model performance. It measures the ratio of correct predictions to the total number of predictions. With balanced class distribution, accuracy provides a comprehensive evaluation of the model's classification accuracy for both categories.

## Conclution
<blockquote><p style="font-size:16px; color:#159364; font-family:verdana;">üí¨ 
The model has an accuracy of 0.90 with the data we have worked with. The current model is a prototype 1.0 that has been trained on AI-generated artwork images as well as non-AI-generated images. The goal is to train it with images from different segments. For example, it can compare AI-generated dog images with real dog images, or focus solely on comparisons among humans. The objective is to achieve a model that maintains consistent performance across different data types.</p></blockquote>
